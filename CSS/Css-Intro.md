# What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language that is used to describe the visual presentation of a web page written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).

HTML creates the structure of the page, while CSS adds styling to that structure. 

# Why the word "cascade"?
The term "cascade" refers to the priority scheme determining which CSS rules are applied when multiple rules target an element. This scheme takes into account specificity and inheritance, ensuring that the most specific and latest rules are applied.

# Why use CSS?
CSS is used to provide styling to HTML elements, making web pages visually appealing and user-friendly.


# Analogy to Understand CSS
Imagine reading a book with only plain text. It's quite dull, isn't it? Now picture a book enriched with different colors, fonts, and styles. That's what CSS does to a webpage.

# How does CSS work?
CSS operates by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them. Styles dictate the appearance of elements on a webpage. You can target HTML elements, classes, or IDs, defining properties like colors, fonts, margins, etc.


  ```html
/* Example of a CSS rule */
selector {
    property: value;
}
```

# A Bit of History
CSS was created by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie to enhance the visual aspects of websites. Initially, websites were mainly used by researchers and lacked visual appeal. As websites became more widespread, the need for better design grew.
