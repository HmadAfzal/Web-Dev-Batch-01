# HTML Inline and Block Elements

Inline Elements don't start on a new line. It only takes the width required to cover the content.

HTML elements are generally divided into two categories: Block-level and Inline elements.

No matter what the width is, block elements will always start on a new line and take up the full available width of their container by default. This means they essentially claim all the horizontal space for themselves, pushing any content that comes after them to a new line. But the inline elements will fit snugly within the flow of other elements, taking up only as much width as their content requires.

## What are Inline Elements?
Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They are part of the flow within other elements.
Here is an exhaustive list of the most used Inline Elements:

- `<a>`
- `<button>`
- `<br>`
- `<b>`
- `<i>`
- `<em>`
- `<img>`
- `<input>`
- `<select>`
- `<span>`
- `<strong>`
- `<textarea>`

## What are Block-level Elements?
Block-level elements are those that start on a new line and take up the entire width of their container by default. They essentially claim all the horizontal space for themselves, pushing any content that comes after them to a new line.

Characteristics of Block-level Elements:
- Always start on a new line.
- Take up the full width available.
- Width and height can be controlled via CSS.
- Can contain other block-level as well as inline elements.
